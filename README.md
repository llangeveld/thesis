# Bachelor's thesis
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/20c17cfe929846dda39b1a3d63fc3fc9)](https://www.codacy.com/app/llangeveld/thesis?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=llangeveld/thesis&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Running the code
To run the code, simply run `thesis.py`.

## How does the GitHub work?
The main file (`thesis.py`) is in the main folder, along with the inter-annotator script (`annotation.py`). In the folder _Resources_, one can find any and all .csv-files that are used in one of the two main scripts. The folder _Resources_ has a sub-folder _oldresources_, where one can find all 'substeps' that happened in annotation (be careful, though - it's quite a mess!). 
In the folder _oldpython_, one can find all old Python scripts, as the name suggests. These were either some sort of test files, or helped create some of the files. In the _Documents_ folder, any actual documents (`.pdf`) can be found (such as the research proposal, or, when finished, the thesis itself).
